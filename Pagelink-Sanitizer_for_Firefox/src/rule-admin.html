	<h1>introduction</h1>
Hacking someone by sending them an email which when opened secretly downloads malware to their computer, should not be possible.

Web-based email software typically has the option of disabling html-rendering. Which if switched-on, would prevent someone placing a practically invisible image-link in an email, the opening of which would automatically download the malware.
<br/>
Most user do not take advantage of this feature. And even if they did, it would not prevent the same thing happening in a browser chat window. The problem is not in the transmission, it is the unrestricted presentation.
<br/>


<p/>



	<h2>how it works</h2>
This add-on operates through disabling all links to the outside from pages matching the policy rules. Link to the outside are link that start with a http(s) and where the domain name in the link is to another domain than the page. 
<br/>An example
<br/>A email contains a link to https://www.google.com/some/thing
<br/>The email is read in the gmail web-based email reader with address "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox"
<br/>Among the default policies that comes with the plugin, is a policy to control pages on the hostname https://mail.google.com/. Here this policy means that all links going to outside the google.com domain will be disabled.
Using web-based Gmail to read the email above would render the link inert and the message safe. 
 
<p/>
	<h3>what do you do</h3>
Not much. The links to outside local domain on the target pages are no longer operative. You can allways copy them manually into the navigation bar, deleting the "disabled" part and use them.  
<p/>
Or use the Link Looker add-on to make the disabled link accessible. Just right-click on the link and select "reveal the true endpoint of this link"

Simply place the cursor over the link in question right click on the mouse. In the context menu selection "reveal true endpoint of this link"
<br/>A small message box will appear where your cursor is. It will contain the endpoint of this URL. If there are any re-writing rules that pertain to this URL, they would have been applied. 
You can click on this link directly. Some users may prefer to take the opportunity open this link in a private browser window (righ-click in the link and select this option from context menu). The message box will close automatically after 30 seconds. 
<p/>
<h3>What happens</h3>
Any links found inside the page that that with http or https and contain another domain name than the local one, gets "disabled" added to the beginning of them. Where before they started with "http.." they will now start with "disabledhttp..". The browser can not make sense of this and the links will not be called. 
This is not restricted to only the typical "clickable links" (The "a href" in html) but includes all all elements that can contain external links. </br> The "HREF" attribute on
 elements A, AREA, LINK and BASE. And the SRC attribute on elements SCRIPT, IMG, IFRAM, EMBED, AUDIO, INPUT, SOURCE, TRACK and VIDEO. 
 Her the SRC attribute of the SCRIPT and IMG tags are of particular importance as links contained here are called automatically by the browser; No user action required. 
<p/>Web links may also be called in the background by embedded javascript - you will not see these on-screen. Such hidden web calls is the more typical scenario in cases of attempted hacking and attacks against the user. The capability of this add-on to block such calls therefore it's most critical feature.

	<h2>policies</h2>
	

<p/>
Policies are grouped according to source, on what page the links are found. but the rewriting applies to the where the link points to, not where it is from. 


			
			

					<h2>Domain-based Policies</h2>
					Policy applies to all pages within a whole domain such as "google.com"
					
<div id="sourceDomainPolicy" indexeddbname="sourceDomainPolicyDB" objectstorename="sourceDomainPolicyStore">
<button class="ll_button_boolean" id="hide_sourceDomainPolicyDB_button" bool="0" target_id="sourceDomainPolicyDB_table">hide table</button>

<button class="ll_button_boolean" id="add_sourceDomainPolicyDB_button" bool="1" target_id="sourceDomainPolicyDB_table">add domain rule</button>
</div>
<h2>Hostname Policies</h2>
					Policy applies to all pages with a given hosname "https://mail.google.com"

<div id="sourceHostnamePolicy" indexeddbname="sourceHostnamePolicyDB" objectstorename="sourceHostnamePolicyStore">
<button class="ll_button_boolean" id="hide_sourceHostnamePolicyDB_button" bool="1" target_id="sourceHostnamePolicyDB_table">hide table</button>
<button class="ll_button_boolean" id="add_sourceHostnamePolicyDB_button" bool="1" target_id="sourceHostnamePolicyDB_table">add rule for hostname</button>
</div>

					<h2>URL/Page Policies</h2>
					Policy applies to particular URLs, such as "https://www.google.fi/maps"
<div id="sourceURLPolicy" indexeddbname="sourceURLPolicyDB" objectstorename="sourceURLPolicyStore">
<button class="ll_button_boolean" id="hide_sourceURLPolicyDB_button" bool="1" target_id="sourceURLPolicyDB_table">hide table</button>
<button class="ll_button_boolean" id="add_sourceURLPolicyDB_button" bool="1" target_id="sourceURLPolicyDB_table">add URL rule</button>
</div>
